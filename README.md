#Documentation
The cloned website is mobile-responsive, featuring some subtle animations to enhance the user experience. One notable improvement I made was making the navbar sticky, as it was not in the original site. This change enhances navigation and overall aesthetics.

I have thoroughly tested the site on various browsers and ensured that it is compatible with all of them. In cases where Internet Explorer required webkit support, I added it to guarantee a seamless browsing experience for all users.

While working on the homepage, I encountered a slight delay in the JavaScript slider's loading time. Unfortunately, due to my ongoing exams, I couldn't complete that particular portion. However, it can be easily fixed, and I'm more than willing to address it if given the opportunity to continue working on the project.
